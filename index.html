                Hello, <br><br>
                As you know, our Dad, Ginger Otum-Mba touched many lives, including yours. We’re collecting tributes to be read during the funeral service and would love for you to contribute. <br><br>
                It could be a favourite memory, a quality you admired, or just a few words about how he impacted your life. There’s no need for it to be long or formal - whatever feels right to you. <br><br>
                If you’d like to share something, please send it to us by 22-09-24. Your words will help us honour our Dad in a meaningful way. <br><br>
                Thank you so much for being part of this celebration of his life. <br><br>
                Warm regards, <br>
                Mike Otum-Mba (on behalf of the family)
            </p>
